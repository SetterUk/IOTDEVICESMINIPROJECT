## üìä Device Parameters

### **üë§ User ID** (1-100)
- Identifier for the device owner
- Different users may have different usage patterns
- Default: 5

### **‚è∞ Usage Hours/Day** (0-24 hours)
- How many hours per day the device is actively used
- **Low**: 0-8 hours (occasional use)
- **Medium**: 8-16 hours (regular use)
- **High**: 16-24 hours (continuous/heavy use)
- Default: 12 hours

**Impact on Efficiency:**
- Too low: Device may not be properly utilized
- Too high: May indicate power waste or constant use

### **‚ö° Energy Consumption** (0-10 units)
- Measured power usage of the device
- **Low** (0-3): Energy-efficient devices
- **Medium** (3-6): Average consumption
- **High** (6-10): Power-hungry devices
- Default: 5 units

**Impact on Efficiency:**
- Lower consumption = More likely efficient
- Higher consumption = Efficiency depends on usage

### **‚ú® User Preferences** (Low / High)
- User's preference setting or configuration level
- **Low (0)**: Basic functionality, minimal customization
- **High (1)**: Advanced features, full customization enabled
- Default: Low

**Impact on Efficiency:**
- Advanced features may increase power consumption
- Simpler settings tend to be more efficient

### **üîß Malfunction Incidents** (0-10)
- Number of times the device has malfunctioned/failed
- **0**: Never had issues
- **1-3**: Minor occasional issues
- **4-6**: Regular problems
- **7+**: Frequent failures
- Default: 2 incidents

**Impact on Efficiency:**
- More malfunctions = Likely inefficient
- Devices with issues often waste energy

### **üìÖ Device Age** (0-60 months)
- How old the device is in months
- **New** (0-6 months): Should be efficient
- **Recent** (6-24 months): Good performance expected
- **Aging** (24-48 months): Degradation starting
- **Old** (48+ months): Efficiency declining
- Default: 24 months

**Impact on Efficiency:**
- Newer devices tend to be more efficient
- Older devices accumulate wear and reduce efficiency

## üîÆ Prediction Output

### **Efficiency Status**
- **‚úÖ Efficient**: Device is working well with good energy management
- **‚ùå Inefficient**: Device is consuming power wastefully or malfunctioning

### **Confidence Score**
- **80-100%**: High confidence prediction (very reliable)
- **60-80%**: Medium confidence (reasonably reliable)
- **Below 60%**: Low confidence (may need verification)

### **Prediction Code**
- **1**: Efficient
- **0**: Inefficient

## üíæ Batch Prediction Format

For **Batch Prediction**, upload a CSV with these columns (in any order):

```csv
DeviceType,UserID,UsageHoursPerDay,EnergyConsumption,UserPreferences,MalfunctionIncidents,DeviceAgeMonths
Smart Speaker,5,12,2,0,0,24
Camera,10,18,8,1,3,36
Lights,15,8,1,0,0,6
```

The app will:
1. Validate your data
2. Normalize the features
3. Make predictions for each device
4. Return results with confidence scores
5. Allow you to download the results as CSV

## üéØ Tips for Better Predictions

1. **Use accurate data** - The more precise your input values, the better the prediction
2. **Keep tracking** - Monitor device age and malfunction incidents regularly
3. **Consider efficiency** - Devices with many incidents should be repaired or replaced
4. **Balance usage** - Very high usage hours may indicate inefficient operation
5. **Check energy levels** - Unusually high energy consumption warrants investigation
