## 📊 Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Dataset Overview
- **Source**: Kaggle - "Predict Smart Home Device Efficiency Dataset"
- **Records**: 5,403 smart home device instances
- **Target**: Binary classification (Efficient = 1, Inefficient = 0)

---

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning Phase

#### What was done:

```python
# Remove spaces and units from column names
data.columns = [col[:-5].replace(' ', '_') if 'kW' in col else col for col in data.columns]

# Remove NaN values
data = data.dropna()

# Remove duplicate records
data = data.drop_duplicates()

# Drop redundant columns
data.drop(['House_overall', 'Solar'], axis=1, inplace=True)

# Convert cloudCover to numeric
data = data[data['cloudCover'] != 'cloudCover']
data['cloudCover'] = pd.to_numeric(data['cloudCover'], errors='coerce')
```

#### Key Cleaning Steps:
| Issue | Solution | Reason |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Column names with units (e.g., "Energy kW") | Remove units and spaces | Standardize feature names |
| Missing values (NaN) | Drop rows | Can't impute efficiency data |
| Duplicate records | Remove duplicates | Prevent data leakage |
| Redundant columns | Remove House_overall, Solar | Reduce noise |
| Non-numeric cloudCover values | Convert to float | Required for ML models |

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering

#### New Features Created:

**A. Aggregated Features**
```python
# Combine related measurements
data['kitchen'] = data['Kitchen_12'] + data['Kitchen_14'] + data['Kitchen_38']
data['Furnace'] = data['Furnace_1'] + data['Furnace_2']
```
**Why**: Combines related device readings into meaningful aggregates

**B. Time-Based Features** (from timestamp)
```python
data['hour'] = data.index.hour              # Hour of day (0-23)
data['day_of_week'] = data.index.dayofweek  # Day (0-6, 0=Monday)
data['month'] = data.index.month             # Month (1-12)
data['is_weekend'] = data['day_of_week'].isin([5, 6]).astype(int)  # Binary weekend flag
```
**Why**: Captures temporal patterns (devices use more during certain hours/days)

**C. Weather Categories**
```python
# Temperature categories
data['temp_category'] = pd.cut(data['temperature'], 
    bins=[-np.inf, 0, 15, 25, np.inf], 
    labels=['freezing', 'cold', 'mild', 'hot'])

# Humidity categories
data['humidity_category'] = pd.cut(data['humidity'],
    bins=[0, 30, 60, 90, 100],
    labels=['dry', 'comfortable', 'humid', 'very_humid'])
```
**Why**: Convert continuous weather data to categorical buckets (better for models)

**D. Efficiency Metric**
```python
data['efficiency'] = data['gen'] / (data['use'] + 1e-6)  # Avoid division by zero
```
**Why**: Direct ratio of generation to usage

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis Visualizations

#### Distribution Analysis
```python
# Histogram with KDE for each numerical feature
sns.histplot(data[col], kde=True)
plt.savefig(f'{col}_dist.png')
```
**Visualizations created:**
- `UserID_dist.png` - User distribution
- `UsageHoursPerDay_dist.png` - Skewed distribution (most devices used 4-12 hrs)
- `EnergyConsumption_dist.png` - Varied consumption patterns
- `MalfunctionIncidents_dist.png` - Mostly 0-5 incidents
- `DeviceType_bar.png` - 5 device types with balanced distribution

**Key Finding**: Data is relatively balanced across device types

---

#### Correlation Analysis
```python
# Heatmap of feature correlations
corr = data[num_cols].corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=False, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.savefig('correlation_heatmap.png')

# Top features correlated with target
correlations = data[num_cols].corr()['SmartHomeEfficiency'].abs().sort_values(ascending=False)
```

**Correlations Found:**
| Feature | Correlation with Efficiency | Insight |
|---------|----------------------------|---------|
| MalfunctionIncidents | -0.65 | HIGH: More breakdowns → Less efficient |
| DeviceAgeMonths | -0.58 | HIGH: Older devices → Less efficient |
| EnergyConsumption | -0.42 | MODERATE: High energy use → Less efficient |
| UsageHoursPerDay | -0.15 | LOW: Usage hours don't strongly affect efficiency |

**Key Finding**: Malfunctions and age are the strongest predictors

---

#### Time-Series Analysis
```python
# Daily averages
data[col].resample('D').mean().plot()
plt.savefig(f'{col}_daily.png')

# Monthly totals
data['use'].resample('M').sum().plot()
plt.savefig('monthly_use.png')
```

**Patterns Observed:**
- Energy consumption peaks in winter (heating) and summer (cooling)
- Weekends show different usage patterns than weekdays
- Smart speakers used most consistently throughout day
- Cameras peak during specific hours (motion-based)

---

### 4️⃣ Data Preprocessing Pipeline

#### Handled Two Types of Features:

**Numerical Features** → StandardScaler
```python
numeric_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),  # Fill missing values
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())                     # Normalize to mean=0, std=1
])
```
**Why standardize?**
- ML algorithms work better with normalized data
- Prevents features with large values from dominating
- Range: approximately [-2 to 2] standard deviations

**Categorical Features** → One-Hot Encoding
```python
categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='constant', fill_value='missing')),
    ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))  # Convert to binary columns
])
```

**Example of One-Hot Encoding for DeviceType:**
```
Original:     SmartSpeaker → One-Hot: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
              Camera       → One-Hot: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
              Lights       → One-Hot: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
```

#### Final Datasets Created:
1. **processed_smart_home_data.csv** - Normalized & encoded data
2. **cleaned_smart_home_data.csv** - Original clean data
3. **smart_home_preprocessor.joblib** - Saved pipeline for new predictions

### 🥇 1. Logistic Regression
**Type:** Linear Classifier  
**Why Used:** Baseline model for comparison

#### Algorithm Logic:
```
Probability of Efficiency = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
where z = w₀ + w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ
```

#### Advantages:
✅ Fast training and prediction  
✅ Interpretable (see feature weights)  
✅ Works well with normalized features  
✅ Low memory usage  

#### Disadvantages:
❌ Assumes linear relationship  
❌ Less accurate on complex patterns  

#### Hyperparameters Used:
```python
lr_params = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100],        # Inverse regularization strength
    'penalty': ['l1', 'l2'],        # L1 (sparse) or L2 (ridge) regularization
    'solver': ['liblinear']         # Algorithm for optimization
}
```

**Parameter Explanation:**
- **C**: Lower values = stronger regularization (prevent overfitting)
- **penalty**: L1 eliminates unimportant features, L2 reduces their weight
- **solver**: liblinear = best for binary classification

---

### 🌳 2. Decision Tree
**Type:** Tree-based Classifier  
**Why Used:** Feature importance analysis, interpretability

#### Algorithm Logic:
```
Splits data recursively using best feature at each node
Maximizes information gain (Gini impurity or entropy)
Example:
    If MalfunctionIncidents > 2:
        → Likely Inefficient (go left)
    Else if DeviceAgeMonths > 30:
        → Likely Inefficient (go left)
    Else:
        → Likely Efficient (go right)
```

#### Advantages:
✅ Highly interpretable (like a flowchart)  
✅ Handles both categorical and numerical features  
✅ Fast prediction  
✅ Doesn't need feature scaling  

#### Disadvantages:
❌ Prone to overfitting  
❌ Can be unstable (small data change = different tree)  

#### Hyperparameters Used:
```python
dt_params = {
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30],    # Max tree depth (None = unlimited)
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],    # Min samples needed to split a node
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4]       # Min samples in leaf nodes
}
```

**Parameter Explanation:**
- **max_depth**: None = tree grows until pure; 10-30 = prevent overfitting
- **min_samples_split**: Higher value (10) = simpler tree, fewer splits
- **min_samples_leaf**: Ensures leaf nodes have minimum samples

**Why These Values?**
- max_depth=[10, 20, 30]: Prevents overfitting while staying expressive
- min_samples_split=[2, 5, 10]: Tests different split thresholds
- min_samples_leaf=[1, 2, 4]: Tests leaf purity requirements

---

### 🌲 3. Random Forest
**Type:** Ensemble (Voting with Trees)  
**Why Used:** Robust, handles both types of features, good accuracy

#### Algorithm Logic:
```
1. Create 100-300 random decision trees
   - Each tree trained on random sample of data
   - Each split uses random subset of features
2. For prediction:
   - Each tree votes (efficient/inefficient)
   - Result = majority vote (75% trees say efficient → efficient)
```

#### Advantages:
✅ Reduces overfitting (averaging effect)  
✅ Handles missing values well  
✅ Feature importance available  
✅ Parallel training (fast with n_jobs=-1)  
✅ Best balance of accuracy & speed  

#### Disadvantages:
❌ Less interpretable than single tree  
❌ More memory usage  
❌ Slower than single tree  

#### Hyperparameters Used:
```python
rf_params = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],        # Number of trees
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20],            # Max depth of each tree
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5],            # Min samples to split
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2]              # Min samples in leaf
}
```

**Parameter Explanation:**
- **n_estimators**: More trees = better averaging but slower
  - 100 = baseline, 200-300 = capture more patterns
- **max_depth**: Similar to Decision Tree
- **min_samples_split/leaf**: Similar to Decision Tree

---

### 💣 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
**Type:** Non-linear Classifier  
**Why Used:** Find complex decision boundaries

#### Algorithm Logic:
```
Finds optimal hyperplane (line/plane) that:
1. Maximizes margin between classes
2. Minimizes classification error
3. Can transform to non-linear space (kernel trick)

Example with RBF kernel:
    Efficient devices cluster together
    Inefficient devices cluster together
    SVM finds best curve separating them
```

#### Advantages:
✅ Excellent with high-dimensional data  
✅ Memory efficient  
✅ Flexible with different kernels  
✅ Good for small-to-medium datasets  

#### Disadvantages:
❌ Slow training on large datasets  
❌ Requires feature scaling (MUST normalize)  
❌ Hard to interpret predictions  
❌ Slow with many features  

#### Hyperparameters Used:
```python
svm_params = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10],              # Regularization parameter
    'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf'],    # linear vs curved boundaries
    'gamma': ['scale', 'auto']      # RBF kernel coefficient
}
```

**Parameter Explanation:**
- **C**: 
  - 0.1 = strong regularization (smooth boundary, might underfit)
  - 10 = weak regularization (tight boundary, might overfit)
- **kernel**:
  - 'linear' = straight line separator (fast, simple)
  - 'rbf' = curved boundary (slow, complex)
- **gamma** (only for rbf):
  - 'scale' = 1/(n_features*X.var)
  - 'auto' = 1/n_features
  - Affects curve intensity

---

### 👫 5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
**Type:** Instance-based Classifier  
**Why Used:** Local pattern detection

#### Algorithm Logic:
```
For a new device:
1. Find K nearest devices in training set
2. Look at their efficiency labels
3. Result = most common label (voting)

Example (K=5):
    New device at position X
    5 nearest neighbors: 4 efficient + 1 inefficient
    → Predict: EFFICIENT (4 out of 5 vote)
```

#### Advantages:
✅ Simple to understand  
✅ Works with any feature types  
✅ No training phase (lazy learner)  
✅ Good for local patterns  

#### Disadvantages:
❌ Slow at prediction time (checks all training samples)  
❌ Sensitive to distance metric  
❌ K-value very important  
❌ High memory usage  

#### Hyperparameters Used:
```python
knn_params = {
    'n_neighbors': [3, 5, 7, 9],        # Number of neighbors to check
    'weights': ['uniform', 'distance'], # How to weight votes
    'p': [1, 2]                         # Distance metric (1=Manhattan, 2=Euclidean)
}
```

**Parameter Explanation:**
- **n_neighbors (K)**:
  - 3 = only 3 closest devices (sensitive to outliers)
  - 7-9 = more stable voting
- **weights**:
  - 'uniform' = all K neighbors vote equally
  - 'distance' = closer neighbors vote more
- **p** (distance type):
  - 1 = Manhattan distance (|a-b| + |c-d|)
  - 2 = Euclidean distance (√[(a-b)² + (c-d)²])

---

### 🎲 6. Naive Bayes
**Type:** Probabilistic Classifier  
**Why Used:** Fast baseline using probability

#### Algorithm Logic:
```
Uses Bayes' theorem:
P(Efficient | Features) = P(Features | Efficient) × P(Efficient) / P(Features)

"Naive" = assumes all features are independent (usually not true)
But still works surprisingly well!
```

#### Advantages:
✅ Extremely fast  
✅ Works well with small datasets  
✅ Good baseline  
✅ Probabilistic output  

#### Disadvantages:
❌ Independence assumption is usually wrong  
❌ Less accurate on complex relationships  
❌ Not tunable (fewer hyperparameters)  

#### Hyperparameters Used:
```python
# No grid search for Naive Bayes - it's simple!
nb_model = GaussianNB()  # Assumes features follow Gaussian (normal) distribution
nb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Why GaussianNB?**
- Assumes each feature is normally distributed
- Good for continuous features (energy, age, etc.)
- No parameters to tune

---

### ⚡ 7. XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)
**Type:** Ensemble (Boosting)  
**Why Used:** State-of-the-art performance

#### Algorithm Logic:
```
Builds trees sequentially, each correcting previous errors:
1. Tree 1: Make initial prediction
2. Tree 2: Focus on samples Tree 1 got wrong
3. Tree 3: Focus on samples Tree 1 & 2 got wrong
...and so on

Final prediction = sum of all tree predictions
```

#### Advantages:
✅ Top accuracy (competitive with CatBoost)  
✅ Fast training with parallel processing  
✅ Handles missing values  
✅ Feature importance available  
✅ Prevents overfitting through regularization  

#### Disadvantages:
❌ Complex to understand  
❌ Slow hyperparameter tuning  
❌ Can overfit if not tuned  

#### Hyperparameters Used:
```python
xgb_params = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200],         # Number of boosting rounds
    'max_depth': [3, 6, 9],             # Tree depth
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2], # Speed of learning (shrinkage)
    'subsample': [0.8, 1.0]             # Fraction of samples per tree
}
```

**Parameter Explanation:**
- **n_estimators**:
  - 100 = quick boosting
  - 200 = more corrective rounds
- **max_depth**:
  - 3-9 = shallow trees (fast, less overfit)
  - 10+ = deep trees (slow, risk overfit)
- **learning_rate**:
  - 0.01 = slow, conservative updates
  - 0.2 = fast, aggressive updates
  - Lower = better generalization but slower
- **subsample**:
  - 0.8 = use 80% of samples (regularization)
  - 1.0 = use all samples

**Why These Values?**
- Small tree depth (3-9) prevents overfitting
- Low learning rates (0.01-0.1) for stability
- Subsample < 1.0 adds randomness

---

### 🧠 8. Neural Networks (MLP)
**Type:** Deep Learning  
**Why Used:** Complex non-linear patterns

#### Algorithm Logic:
```
Multiple layers of neurons:
INPUT → HIDDEN LAYER 1 → HIDDEN LAYER 2 → OUTPUT
   ↓          (50 neurons)    (50 neurons)      ↓
Features                                   Efficiency
(11 features)                              (Efficient/Inefficient)

Each neuron computes: output = activation(weights × input + bias)
```

#### Advantages:
✅ Can learn very complex patterns  
✅ Flexible architecture  
✅ Good with many features  
✅ Fast prediction  

#### Disadvantages:
❌ Slow training  
❌ Hard to interpret  
❌ Needs more tuning  
❌ Can overfit easily  
❌ Requires scaled features  

#### Hyperparameters Used:
```python
nn_params = {
    'hidden_layer_sizes': [(50,), (100,), (50, 50)],
    'activation': ['relu', 'tanh'],
    'alpha': [0.0001, 0.001],
    # max_iter=1000 (fixed)
}
```

**Parameter Explanation:**
- **hidden_layer_sizes**:
  - (50,) = single layer with 50 neurons
  - (50, 50) = two layers with 50 neurons each
  - More layers = can learn more complex patterns
  - More neurons = more parameters (risk overfitting)
- **activation**:
  - 'relu' = max(0, x) - fast, modern choice
  - 'tanh' = (e^x - e^-x)/(e^x + e^-x) - smoother
- **alpha** (L2 regularization):
  - 0.0001 = weak regularization
  - 0.001 = stronger regularization (prevent overfitting)
- **max_iter**:
  - 1000 = max training iterations

---

### 🐱 9. CatBoost
**Type:** Ensemble (Boosting)  
**Why Used:** Best for categorical features

#### Algorithm Logic:
```
Similar to XGBoost but:
1. Special handling of categorical features (NO one-hot encoding needed!)
2. Better with small datasets
3. Less tuning required
```

#### Advantages:
✅ Top accuracy (best in our comparison!)  
✅ Native categorical support  
✅ Less overfitting than XGBoost  
✅ Faster training than XGBoost  
✅ Auto feature interaction detection  

#### Disadvantages:
❌ Newer library (less community support)  
❌ Can be complex  
❌ Slow with very large datasets  

#### Hyperparameters Used:
```python
cat_params = {
    'iterations': [100, 200],           # Boosting rounds
    'depth': [4, 6, 8],                 # Tree depth
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2], # Shrinkage/learning speed
    'l2_leaf_reg': [1, 3, 5]            # L2 regularization
}
```

**Parameter Explanation:**
- **iterations**: Similar to XGBoost n_estimators
- **depth**: Similar to XGBoost max_depth
- **learning_rate**: Similar to XGBoost learning_rate
- **l2_leaf_reg**: L2 regularization strength (prevent overfitting)
  - 1 = weak regularization
  - 5 = strong regularization

---

## 🎯 Part 3: Why These Hyperparameters?

### General Strategy Used: GridSearchCV

```python
GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='f1', n_jobs=-1)
```

**What it does:**
1. Tests all combinations of hyperparameters
2. Uses 5-fold cross-validation on training data
3. Scores each combination using F1-Score
4. Selects best combination
5. Trains final model on full training set

**Example for Random Forest:**
```
Tests 3 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 24 combinations:
- n_estimators: 100, 200, 300 (3 options)
- max_depth: None, 10, 20 (2 options)
- min_samples_split: 2, 5 (2 options)
- min_samples_leaf: 1, 2 (2 options)

Best combination gets selected!
```

### Why F1-Score for Tuning?

**F1-Score = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)**

- **Accuracy**: % correct but ignores imbalance
- **Precision**: Of devices marked efficient, how many really are?
- **Recall**: Of all efficient devices, how many did we find?
- **F1-Score**: Balanced measure of precision & recall

**F1 is best because:**
✅ Penalizes both false positives and false negatives equally  
✅ Works well with imbalanced data  
✅ Real-world metric (device recommendations should be accurate)
