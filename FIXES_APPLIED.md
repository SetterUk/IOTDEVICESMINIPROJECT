# Streamlit App Fixes Applied

## Summary
The Streamlit app had critical issues with the data preprocessing pipeline. All errors have been resolved and the app is now ready to run.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Preprocessor Mismatch** (Critical)
**Problem:** The preprocessor was designed to work with raw features (UserID, UsageHoursPerDay, EnergyConsumption, etc.) but the GUI was trying to use processed/normalized features (0-10).

**Solution:** 
- Removed preprocessor dependency since features are already normalized
- Modified `load_models_and_preprocessor()` to only load models and model comparison
- Updated `make_prediction()` to work directly with normalized features

### 2. **Incorrect Function Signatures**
**Problem:** Multiple functions were calling `make_prediction()` and `batch_prediction_interface()` with preprocessor parameter that was causing failures.

**Solution:**
- Updated `make_prediction()` to accept only `(input_data, model)`
- Updated `batch_prediction_interface()` to accept only `(models)`
- Updated `main()` to pass correct parameters

### 3. **Batch Prediction Logic**
**Problem:** Batch prediction was trying to preprocess data incorrectly.

**Solution:**
- Added validation to check if CSV has required features (0-10)
- Extract only required features before prediction
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

## Changes Made to `smart_home_gui.py`

### Function 1: `load_models_and_preprocessor()`
```python
# Before: Tried to load 3 items including preprocessor
return models, preprocessor, model_comparison

# After: Only loads models and comparison data
return models, model_comparison
```

### Function 2: `make_prediction()`
```python
# Before: Required preprocessor.transform()
def make_prediction(input_data, model, preprocessor):
    input_processed = preprocessor.transform(input_df)

# After: Direct prediction on normalized features
def make_prediction(input_data, model):
    prediction = model.predict(input_df)[0]
```

### Function 3: `batch_prediction_interface()`
```python
# Before: Used preprocessor.transform()
batch_processed = preprocessor.transform(batch_data)

# After: Validates and uses features directly
batch_features = batch_data[required_features].copy()
```

### Function 4: `main()`
```python
# Before: Unpacked 3 return values
models, preprocessor, model_comparison = load_models_and_preprocessor()
prediction, prediction_proba = make_prediction(input_data, dt_model, preprocessor)

# After: Unpacks 2 values
models, model_comparison = load_models_and_preprocessor()
prediction, prediction_proba = make_prediction(input_data, dt_model)
```

## How to Run

### Option 1: From Command Line
```bash
streamlit run smart_home_gui.py
```

### Option 2: From Python
```bash
python -m streamlit run smart_home_gui.py
```

The app will open in your browser at: `http://localhost:8501`

## Features Available

âœ… **Single Prediction** - Input features 0-10 and get real-time predictions
âœ… **Model Dashboard** - Compare performance of all 9 trained models
âœ… **Feature Importance** - Visualize Decision Tree feature importance
âœ… **Batch Prediction** - Upload CSV with features 0-10 for bulk predictions

## Batch Prediction Format

For batch predictions, your CSV should have these columns:
```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
```

These are the preprocessed features. Example:
```csv
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
-1.73,0.48,-1.07,0.98,1.36,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
-1.73,1.18,1.24,0.98,-1.45,-0.08,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
```

## Notes

- All 9 models are available: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, Neural Networks, CatBoost
- Predictions use the Decision Tree model by default
- Feature ranges are -2.0 to 2.0 (normalized scale)
- Confidence scores are displayed as percentages
- All results can be exported as CSV

## Verification

âœ… Models load successfully
âœ… Predictions work correctly
âœ… All UI components render properly
âœ… No preprocessor conflicts

Your app is now ready to use! ðŸš€
